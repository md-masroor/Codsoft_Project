## 🔹 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Titanic Survival Prediction
**Problem Type:** Binary Classification  

**Description:**  
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as passenger class, gender, age, fare, and embarkation port. Logistic Regression is used to build the classification model.

**Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression  
**Dataset:** Titanic Dataset  

**Output:**  
- Model Accuracy ≈ **80%**  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
- Prediction for new passengers (Survived / Not Survived)

### 2️⃣ Movie Rating Prediction
**Problem Type:** Regression  

**Description:**  
This project predicts the rating of a movie using historical data from the IMDb Movies India dataset. Features such as genre, director, actors, duration, and number of votes are used to estimate movie ratings.

**Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression  
**Dataset:** IMDb Movies India Dataset  

**Output:**  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score  
- Actual vs Predicted Rating visualization  
- Predicted rating for a new movie

### 3️⃣ Iris Flower Classification
**Problem Type:** Multiclass Classification  

**Description:**  
This project classifies Iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on sepal and petal measurements. It is a classic introductory classification problem.

**Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression  
**Dataset:** Iris Flower Dataset  

**Output:**  
- Model Accuracy ≈ **95–100%**  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  
- Predicted species for a new flower sample
